4 weather option

each one of them should have it's own:

error message
data in object
last update time

///////

on app load, it should start with default options (if there is no options in local storage):
load current temperature and set in local storage
  if there is any kind of error, show error box top left corner and load from local storage,
  otherwise fetch data and set to local storage.

load daily data, and save every option's data in local storage
  in case of error, show error box (on top of another error box, if there is one) then either load local storage if possible or show warning in place of weather cards;

set current time for update time even if theres no error;

/////////
